Welcome to my academic page. While working as a computational geneticist in graduate school, I've collected a lot of notes about how various programs/methods/fun little tricks work. I want to use this blog to share those insights, frustrations, and solutions. Some of them may only be useful to members of the Brito Lab, but my hope is that most will be general enough that anyone in the bioinformatics world could find them interesting.
