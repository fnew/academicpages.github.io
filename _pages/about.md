Hi!

This is the personal page for Felicia New. I am a PhD candidate in Genetics, Genomics, & Development at Cornell University. I am in the lab of Dr. Ilana Brito. I am interested in how the human gut microbiome affects human health and how genetics may play a role. I use and develop a variety of computational and statistical tools to investigate this relationship.

To more see more about our awesome lab, [Check out the Brito Lab website here!](https://www.britolab.org)

We recently hosted a Microbiome Hackathon at Cornell. The event was designed to expose students to data science, computational biology, and questions of the microbiome field. To learn more about this fun event, [visit our website](https://www.microbiomehack.org), or read this great write up about the hackathon in the [Cornell Daily Sun!](https://cornellsun.com/2019/04/19/cancer-biology-machine-learning-and-creative-problem-solving-at-cornells-microbiome-hackathon/)
