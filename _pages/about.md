Hi!

This is the academic page for Felicia New. I am a PhD candidate in Genetics, Genomics, & Development at Cornell University. I am in the lab of Dr. Ilana Brito. I am interested in how the human gut microbiome affects human health and how genetics may play a role. I use and develop a variety of computational and statistical tools to investigate this relationship.
