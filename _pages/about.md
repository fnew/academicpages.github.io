Hi!

I am a PhD candidate in the field of Genetics, Genomics, & Development at Cornell University. I am in the lab of Dr. Ilana Brito. I am interested in how the human gut microbiome affects human health and how genetics may play a role in the formation and activity of the gut microbiome. I enjoy developing and applying bioinformatics and statistical tools to address questions about the gut microbiome in novel ways.

Recent News
-----------
#### September 2020
I received the news that I've been awarded an NIH Research Fellowship to continue my research on genetic determinants of the gut microbiome!

#### July 2020
My review paper with Dr. Ilana Brito is out in [Annual Reviews Microbiology](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-micro-012520-072314)! We review the many benefits of using metagenomic sequencing data, such as greater resolution of species/strains/functions, while also highlighting the challenges to metagenomic data analysis.

#### November 2019
Along with two other graduate students, I have been working to establish a new organization at Cornell for first-generation and low-income graduate students. This new organization, known as Cornell's First Generation & Low Income Graduate Student organization, or FiGLI, was officially registered in August. You can see what we are up to by visiting the [FiGLI Facebook page here](https://www.facebook.com/CornellFiGLI/). Excitingly, we have also been featured in various Cornell University news outlets:

* Cornell Chronical: [New Group Supports First Generation and Low Income Students](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/11/new-group-supports-first-generation-and-low-income-students)

* Cornell Daily Sun: [New Campus Group Seeks To Provide Resources for First-Gen College Students](https://cornellsun.com/2019/11/26/new-campus-group-seeks-to-provide-resources-for-first-gen-college-students/)

* [The Graduate School featured me in a Student Spotlight!](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/spotlights/student-spotlight-felicia-new/) In this interview, I discuss my research as well as my involvement in the founding of FiGLI.

#### April 2019
We recently hosted a Microbiome Hackathon at Cornell. The event was designed to expose students to data science, computational biology, and questions of the microbiome field. To learn more about this fun event, [visit our website](http://www.microbiomehack.org), or read this great write up about the hackathon in the [Cornell Daily Sun!](https://cornellsun.com/2019/04/19/cancer-biology-machine-learning-and-creative-problem-solving-at-cornells-microbiome-hackathon/)

#### September 2017
I was honored to be named a [Cornell Graduate Dean's Scholar](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/diversity-inclusion/signature-initiatives/graduate-school-deans-scholars/) at the inaugural pinning ceremony.
