Hi!

I am a PhD candidate in the field of Genetics, Genomics, & Development at Cornell University. I am in the lab of Dr. Ilana Brito. I am interested in how the human gut microbiome affects human health and how genetics may play a role. I use and develop a variety of computational and statistical tools to investigate this relationship. I am interested in the role of the gut microbiome in our overall health and how our genetics shape the formation and activity of the microbiome. A second area of my work involves using 'big data' to track the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes between bacteria residing within the gut microbiome. I enjoy developing and applying bioinformatics and statistical tools to address these questions about the gut microbiome in novel ways.

#### Fall 2020
Along with two other graduate students, I have been working to establish a new organization at Cornell for first-generation and low-income graduate students. This new organization, known as FiGLI, was officially registered in August. To learn more about FiGLI, please visit the [FiGLI Facebook page here](https://www.facebook.com/CornellFiGLI/), or read [this feature in the Cornell Chronical](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/11/new-group-supports-first-generation-and-low-income-students)!

#### Spring 2019
We recently hosted a Microbiome Hackathon at Cornell. The event was designed to expose students to data science, computational biology, and questions of the microbiome field. To learn more about this fun event, [visit our website](http://www.microbiomehack.org), or read this great write up about the hackathon in the [Cornell Daily Sun!](https://cornellsun.com/2019/04/19/cancer-biology-machine-learning-and-creative-problem-solving-at-cornells-microbiome-hackathon/)
