title: "Sex Differences in Drosophila Somatic Gene Expression: Variation and Regulation by doublesex."
collection: publications
excerpt: 'In this study, we focus on the mechanisms used by doublesex (dsx) to generate sexual dimorphism in gene expression, and address the relationship between dsx regulation and consistent sex-differential gene expression across strains. These results provide insights into a more complete pool of potential DSX targets, as well as revealing the molecular flexibility of DSX regulation.'

In this study, we focus on the mechanisms used by doublesex (dsx) to generate sexual dimorphism in gene expression, and address the relationship between dsx regulation and consistent sex-differential gene expression across strains. These results provide insights into a more complete pool of potential DSX targets, as well as revealing the molecular flexibility of DSX regulation.
